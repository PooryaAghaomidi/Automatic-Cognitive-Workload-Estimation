# Automatic-Cognitive-Workload-Estimation
Contemplate On ECG Signal And Enhanced Automatic Cognitive Workload Estimation Using CNN And A Hybrid CNN-LSTM Network 

SEI-CNN is a repository that introduces a novel approach for estimating cognitive workload using a Single Electrocardiogram Input Convolutional Neural Network. This method is designed to extract deep features and classify them into different workload levels. The performance of this method has been assessed and compared to other existing approaches in the domain of estimating cognitive workload.

## Abstract
The project revolves around the development of a reliable, cost-effective, and automatic method for Cognitive Workload Estimation (CWE). The proposed methodology, CWE-SEI-CNN, employs a Single Electrocardiogram Input Convolutional Neural Network that demonstrates high accuracy and robustness, particularly under conditions involving mental fatigue interference.
